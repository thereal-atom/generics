Website for a band with stripe payements

# Project 
This is a stripe application built with a tutorial from WebDev Simplified on youtube. Its a simple website for a band where you can buy merch and albums. It has a fully functional cart system. You can do test stripe payements by using the credit card - '4242 4242 4242 4242' which will create test charges to my stripe account.
